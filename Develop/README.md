# Day Planner Project#

![working-planner](<https://github.com/JonkHunkle/Day-planner/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(23).png?raw=true>)

for this project i was required to use jQuery in order to edit starter code and enable functionality as follows:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
